# Gruppe Adler Map Exporter

Gruppe Adler Map Exporter (grad_meh) is an Arma 3 Modification built on [intercept](https://github.com/intercept/intercept), which allows exporting Arma 3 maps.  
If you wonder what the `h` stands for you should check out [this pull request](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/grad_meh/pull/1).   

The aim of this project is not to generate finished map tiles which can be used for web-maps or similar, but to export all data which might be needed to generate such tiles or basically anything else. So the goal is to export all interesting data of an Arma 3 map. What you will do with that is up to you. The [output section](#Output) outlines what exactly is exported. 

Check out our [FAQ](#FAQ) at the bottom of this README if you ask yourself "How?" or "Why?".

## Installation
Download the latest version of the mod from our [releases page](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/grad_meh/releases). The only dependency, **which has to be loaded as well** is [intercept](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1645973522). 

## Usage
Although we would say that using `grad_meh` is intuitive and mostly self explanatory, we made <a href="https://youtu.be/VdIXrm_eUMc" target="_blank">this short video</a> that explains how to use it.

## Limitations
- To reduce complexity we only allow one export process at a time.
- To reduce complexity it is not possible to stop a running export reliably, except by killing the game.
- MEH cannot export maps included in `.ebo` files, because those are encrypted therefore we cannot get to the map files. 

## Output
We export the following from Arma 3 maps:
- Elevation model
- Preview picture
- Satellite image
- Vector data for all map objects / locations
- Any interesting meta data like display name, longitude, latitude, etc.

All exported files can be found in the `grad_meh` subdirectory of your Arma 3 installation directory. Each map has its own subdirectory, which structure is further explained [here](./docs/output_spec.md).

## Scripting API
Gruppe Adler Map Exporter adds a script command, which is used by the UI. If you want to, you could leverage that scripting command for your own purposes.

### `gradMehExportMap`
|**Syntax**| |  
|---|---|  
|Description| Export given parts of given map. |
|||
|Syntax| **gradMehExportMap** [mapId, sat, houses, previewImg, meta, dem]
|||
|Parameters|[mapId, sat, houses, previewImg, meta, dem]: [Array](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Array)|
||mapId: [String](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/String) - CfgWorlds class name of map|
||sat: [Boolean](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Boolean) - Export sat images|
||houses: [Boolean](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Boolean) - Export houses positions|
||previewImg: [Boolean](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Boolean) - Export preview image|
||meta: [Boolean](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Boolean) - Export meta.json|
||dem: [Boolean](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Boolean) - Export Digital Elevation Model|
|||
|Return Value| [Number](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Number) - Status code<br>`0` - Export process started nominally<br>`1` - Error: Invalid arguments given<br>`2` - Error: Another export is currently running<br>`3` - Error: Map wasn't found in config file<br>`4` - Error: Map invalid because `worldSize` field in config is missing<br>`5` - Error: PBO of map's WRP not found (Most likely because it is an EBO)<br>`6` - Error: PBO map still populating (MEH has to do this once upon game start, before it can export anything)

## FAQ

### How long will an export take?
How long an export takes will vary a lot depending on what exactly you want to do, with the biggest influencing factors being map size, object count and how powerful your system is.  
But for reference: It took us less than three minutes to export everything for Stratis on a normal gaming system (i7-6700K@4.00Ghz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, 16 GB RAM).

### Is there some exported data already available for download
Yes, check out [this repository](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/meh-data). (We would appreciate if you contribute exported maps to this repository)

### Can I just tab out while the export process is running?
Yes you can tab out and use your PC otherwise while the export is running, but we recommend starting with the [`-noPause` Arma 3 startup parameter](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Startup_Parameters#Developer_Options), or Gruppe Adler MEH will not initiate the export of pending maps, while tabbed out.  
Oh... and yeah and your CPU utilization will probably peak around 100% while MEH is running so have fun being productive. ðŸ˜‰

### How does grad_meh work?
grad_meh utilizes the [arma file formats C++ library](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/grad_aff) to parse all map relevant files. So most of the magic is done there.
